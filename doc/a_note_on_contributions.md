### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project 3

Team members: Huize Huang, Mengchen Wang, Rui Wang, Jiadong Wu, Qin Zhang

Summary: In this project, we developed improved the classification accuracy for facial emotion recognition accuracy for images to 56.2%

[Contribution Statement] (In the following context, "all team members" refers to the team meambers listed above.) All team members listed above discussed and decided the models to build in this project.

    For the model training, Qin Zhang designed and trained the baseline model (GBM) in R. Rui Wang conducted PCA on the data and designed and trained the SVM model in R. Mengchen Wang designed and trained LDA and Logistic Regression model in R. Jiadong Wu designed and trained Random Forest model in R and Neural Network model in Pytnon. Huize Huang designed and trained XGboost model in R and designed the ensemble model. The ensemble model is trained by Rui. 
    
    For the other work, Rui integrated the codes of main file, with Huize providing some edits. Qin and Mengchen worked on the presentation slides. Huize contributed to the readme files and contribution statement on github.
  
    Ryan Walters was assigned to our group at first. He joined the first online meting and offered to designed and trained the Convolutional Neural Network model. But he never share his work or code with the rest of the team and hasn't replied to the rest of the team since Mar.29th.
